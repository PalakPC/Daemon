A daemon C program to insert a kernel module to print 'Hello World!' if not inserted and delete it if already present every 5 seconds.

It can be compiled through the following statement:

gcc daemon.c -o daemon

To execute it, use the following command:

sudo ./daemon 

When executed, it writes 'Hello World' to kernel log, if module is not already present. In the other case, it removes the module. This process is repeated every 5 seconds (Required kernel module's .ko file is present in the repository). The result can be viewed through the following statement:

dmesg | tail -10
